I was one of the [student PC members][studentpc] for the **39th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy** (IEEE S&P Oakland). Since this was my first review experience for a reputed academic conference, I thought of writing down my experience for my own (as well as others) future reference.

"Student PC" or shadow PC mainly consists of doctoral students and post-docs to mimick the actual review procedures of a typical academic conference by shadowing the actual program commitee (comprising of professors and other industry professionals). It is becoming an official part of good conferenes, for example, earlier with [Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS)][PETS] and [The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS)][ndss], and starting from last year, also with IEEE S&P Oakland. It is mainly for the early-stage research students to gain first-hand experince of being part of a review committee.

This year's student PC was headed by [**Prof. Thorsten Holz**][thorsten], Ruhr-University Bochum, who did a great job of introducing all of the student PC members to the review process and guided all of us throughout different stages of the process.

The whole review process was divided into following parts:
1. Pre-review tele-meeting.
2. Bidding of the papers, followed by paper assignment to the student PC for reviewing.
3. Actual review of the papers assigned, followed by online discussion.
4. In-person meeting with all the other student PC members in the Google office, New York.

### 1. Pre-review tele-meeting

This tele-meeting included a nice overview of future steps that the student PC members are expected to do. Prof. Thorsten gave a brief overview ([his presentation slides][instructions]) of all the things that we should be aware of. First and foremost step was to register ourselves as a reviewer to the submission system (i.e. **HOTCRP**). While most of were familiar with such submission systems (of course, as authors), this was the first time we all got a chance to sneak behind the scenes of review process. We were given instructions on our goals, How program committees operate, considerations of PC members, conflicts disclosure, What makes a good review, and the timeline of next steps. 

Here are some pointers on *writing a good review*: [Thoughts on Reviewing][r1], [Notes on Constructive and Positive Reviewing][r2] and [How NOT to review a paper: The tools and techniques of the adversarial reviewer][r3].


### 2. Paper bidding and assignment

We were then asked to bid **for or against** the papers that each of us wanted to review. Depending on the review/submmission system, positive bid score means the reviewer is interested to review the paper and the negative score to show that reviewer is not interested. Typically, these scores range from -20 to +20. The conflicts (e.g. reviewer is a co-author, previous co-worker/collaborator in the past two years, primary advisor no-matter how long ago, etc.) are marked with **-100**.

If the reviewers bid, their chances that they are asssigned to review the paper of their choice is high. Lazy reviewers who fail to bid for or against will get random papers (papers that are disposed by other reviwers) are assigned by the PC chair. 

Most of us got the papers that we wanted to review. Of course, we chose those papers where we felt we are comfortable with!
