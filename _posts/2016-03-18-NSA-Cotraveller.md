Most of us have read Washington Post’s coverage of National Security issues, in particular the investigative articles on Snowden files. Several people have done research based on the files revealed by Snowden mainly to contribute to investigative journalism series(e.g. “What They Know” series by Wall Street Journal). Out of such abundant information and interpretations available on the Internet, Ashkan Soltani’s series on the analysis of backend systems used by NSA during mass surveillance sought my interest for the following two reasons: 1. It is a well narrated series both in terms of technical depth and impact on the end-users (civilians) 2. The backend systems extensively utilized a protocol called “Siganlling System No. 7” - which has been the area of my interest since my master’s thesis.

For some reasons, I took special interest to dig deep into vulnerabilities based on SS7 protocol and I have discussed the same in my subsequent publications such as unblocking stolen mobiles using SS7-MAP vulnerabilities or downgrading LTE networks using to enable user tracking. In this post, I will continue what Ashkan has discussed in his article to provide a deeper insight on How NSA did it! Mainly, I will discuss the end to end mechanism of NSA’s Co-traveller surveillance program.
