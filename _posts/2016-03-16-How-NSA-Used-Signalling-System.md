## Surveillance using signalling protocols

Most of us have read Washington Post’s coverage of National Security issues, in particular the investigative articles on Snowden files. Several people have done research based on the [files](https://cryptome.org/2013/11/snowden-tally.htm) revealed by Snowden mainly to contribute to investigative journalism series(e.g. “What They Know” series by Wall Street Journal). Out of such abundant information and interpretations available on the Internet, [Ashkan Soltani](https://twitter.com/ashk4n)'s series on the [analysis of backend systems used by NSA during mass surveillance](http://ashkansoltani.org/work/washpost/) sought my interest for the following two reasons:
1. It is a well narrated series both in terms of technical depth and impact on the end-users (civilians)
2. The backend systems extensively utilized a protocol called "Siganlling System No. 7" - which has been the area of my interest since my [master's thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/19044).
