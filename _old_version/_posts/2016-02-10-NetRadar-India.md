### **TL;DR**:
**NetRadar-India** is a crowdsourced user study, to analyze the technology dependent deficiencies in the mobile network 
infrastructure. To know more about how to participate, please visit our [website](http://netradar-india.github.io/).

### **About:**
Internet connectivity around the world is far from uniform, especially when Internet is emerging as one of the fundamental 
civil rights in developing nations, just like their so-called developed counterparts. In the case of India, a semi-developed 
(rather than developing) nation,  the technology penetration is not uniform across the regions where the disparity is evident 
in the infrastructure, cost of access and telecom services to provide Internet facilities among different economic classes. 
To gauge where we stand in leaderboards of emerging technologies, it is very crucial to analyze the variety of connectivity, 
and how the technology is evolving. The understanding of global Internet experience and exposure plays a key role when our 
mission is to ensure that the `Internet is for everyone`.

The technological evolution heavily influences majority of the world to adapt to the swift changes in commercial standardizations.
However, India falls back to fit into such global norms for many things, given its size and complexity, and telecommunication 
services is one of them. In spite of having one of the largest mobile userbase, Indian mobile Internet networks are still 
remarkably slower than in the developed countries. Furthermore, fraudulent episodes of 2G spectrum scams, not only questions 
the ethicality of our democratic government, but also haunts the possible incapability of telecom operators, if any. 

In order to asses the state of mobile networks in India and its readiness in adopting and using the latest mobile standards 
for commercial use we have launched the **Netradar-India project** - a crowdsourced user study, thereby addressing the technology 
dependent deficiencies in the mobile network infrastructure. Hailing as an academic research initiative, NetRadar-India is not 
targeted towards government or telecom operators, but definitely it would create awareness among the common people about the 
infrastructure behind the services that they are paying for. Additionally, we believe that such an assessment would help to 
improve feasibility, scalability, security, privacy, robustness, and performance of tomorrow's mobile network. We are trying 
to accelerate and scale our research efforts by leveraging cost-effective solutions like crowdsourcing.

Leveraging open and free softwares/standards, and the community's participation in campaigns against Net Neutrality in recent 
past has brought a tremendous impact. In the same realm, we expect the community members to join us to propose new solutions/improvements 
for emerging digital India through this project.
